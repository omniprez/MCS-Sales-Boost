# MCS Sales Boost - Dashboard Fix

This repository contains a solution to fix the dashboard API issues that cause "Error loading data" messages.

## Problem Overview

The dashboard is trying to load data from specific API endpoints like:
- `/api/dashboard/revenue-summary`
- `/api/dashboard/pipeline-summary`
- etc.

However, these endpoints are returning 404 Not Found errors from the Vercel deployment.

## Solution

This repository provides three different approaches to fix the issue:

### 1. Client-side Fix (Recommended for Immediate Results)

The `client-fix.js` and `dashboard-fix.html` files provide a browser-based solution that:
- Intercepts API requests to dashboard endpoints
- Returns realistic mock data if the API returns a 404 error
- Works immediately without server deployment

To use:
1. Open `dashboard-fix.html` in your browser
2. Click "Install Dashboard Fix"
3. Open your dashboard page to see data loaded correctly

### 2. API Proxy Server

The `api-proxy.js` file creates a local proxy server that:
- Forwards dashboard API requests to your main API
- Provides proper error handling
- Can be extended to provide mock data

To use:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run proxy` to start the proxy server
3. Configure your client to use the proxy URL (`http://localhost:8080/api`)

### 3. Server-side Fix (Long-term Solution)

The `api/index.js` file has been updated to:
- Handle all dashboard endpoint routes
- Provide consistent API responses
- Work properly with Vercel's routing

To deploy:
1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository
2. Allow Vercel to deploy the updated API

## Technical Details

The primary issue was that:
1. The client code makes direct requests to specific dashboard endpoints
2. The Vercel deployment wasn't properly routing these requests to our API handler
3. The API code itself didn't have specific handlers for each dashboard endpoint

All three solutions address this fundamental mismatch between client expectations and server capabilities.

## Mock Data

The client-side fix includes realistic mock data for all dashboard components, including:
- Revenue summary and trends
- Pipeline distribution
- Sales leaderboard
- Win and conversion rates
- Average deal sizes

This data will make your dashboard look realistic while you implement the proper API endpoints.
